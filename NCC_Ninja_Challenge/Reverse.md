Open the binary file with idaq. Then I found there's a variable named as "flag" in data section. It points to a string looks like the flag format, but not the real flag. We had to decrypt it. This is a simple rot13 encryption. We can get the flag after decrypt it.  
The flag is: _flag{47c199b44ef712973205f84e44448a769f67c3ce6ed1ed9ade634338fc81a579}_
