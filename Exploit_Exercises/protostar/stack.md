# Exploit-Exercises Protostar Writeup - Stack

## [Stack0](https://exploit-exercises.com/protostar/stack0/)
This is a very basic overflow. Any input having a length greater than 64 works. 


## [Stack1](https://exploit-exercises.com/protostar/stack1/)
On this level, we have to overwrite the value of 'modified' to 0x61626364, which is "abcd" in ascii characters. Protostar is little endian, so we have to reverse it when we write it into a stack.    
    ```./stack1 $(python -c 'print "A"*64+"dcba"')```   


## [Stack2](https://exploit-exercises.com/protostar/stack2/)
This one is almost the same as the previous one. The only difference is the buffer comes from a environment variable called "GREENIE".   
We should set the environment variable and then run the program. The commands are:    
'''
    export GREENIE=$(python -c 'print "A"*64+"0x0a0x0d0x0a0xd"')
    ./stack2
'''
